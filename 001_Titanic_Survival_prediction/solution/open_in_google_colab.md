
# Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab

In order to open a jupyter notebook in google colab, you have to replace "github.com/..." to "colab.research.google.com/github/..." and it will open in Google Colab (considering you are having a signed in account in google).

So "https://github.com/aarpit1010/99-ML-Learning-Projects/blob/master/001_Titanic_Survival_prediction/solution/Titanic%20Survival%20Analysis.ipynb" will become  "https://colab.research.google.com/github/aarpit1010/99-ML-Learning-Projects/blob/master/001_Titanic_Survival_prediction/solution/Titanic%20Survival%20Analysis.ipynb"
