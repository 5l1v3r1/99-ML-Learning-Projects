# My Solution

In this folder, you will find two approaches to modeling the Titanic survival prediciton classfication problem:

## Classical approach: 

In `Titanic_Classical.ipynb`, you will find a detailed data wrangling approach to clean and prepare the data. Moreoever, classical machine learning classifiers from the list below are used:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- KNN or K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- SGDClassifier
- Random Forest
- Gaussian Naive Bayes


## Simple neural network:

In `Titanic_TF_NN.ipynb`, you will find a simple 5-layer neural network approach performing the survival classfication task. This is done using Tensorflow using Keras as frontend/API.
