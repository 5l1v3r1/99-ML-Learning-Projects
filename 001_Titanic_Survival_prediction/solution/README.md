# My Solution

In this folder, you will find two approaches to modeling the Titanic survival prediciton problem:

1. In `Titanic Survival Analysis.ipynb`, you will find a detailed data wrangling approach to clean and prepare the data. Moreoever, classical machine learning classifiers from the list below are used:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- KNN or K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- SGDClassifier
- Random Forest
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

2. In `Titanic_neu_net_keras.ipynb`, you are invited to a simple 5-layer neuron network performing a classfying task. This is done using Tensorflow using Keras as frontend/API.
