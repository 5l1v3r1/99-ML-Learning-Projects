# Guidance on how to contribute

There are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Improving the code-base.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
Furthermore, propose new exercises to be included int his repo.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Improving the code-base_
guidance below.


## Improving the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull request (PR). 
This is the primary way for you to submit solutions to the exercise in codes. 

If you are not familir with git, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow] (https://github.com/susam/gitpr):

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone the project to your machine.
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name. It is best practice not to work with the master branch.
4. Commit changes to the branch.
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo.
6. Push changes to your fork.
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
8. After reviewers approve the PR, your branch (and changes) will be merged to the master branch.
