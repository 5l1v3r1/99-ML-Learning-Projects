# Guidance on how to contribute

There are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Changing the code-base.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
Furthermore, propose new exercises to be included int his repo.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_
guidance below.


## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull request. 

This is the primary way for you to submit solutions to the exercise in codes. 
If you are not familira with git, we will include more details in a later version of this guidance
