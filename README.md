# 99-ML-Learning-Projects
A list of 99 machine learning projects for anyone interested to learn machine learning from coding and building projects.

This is still work-in-progress, but I hope that people can start contributing codes. For now, I'm going with the 'create whatever and we will sort out later' approach. Feel free to create issues to propose ideas, questions, comments and complaints. 

## Format and contribution:

The format is roughly the following:
1. Propose an exercise by creating an issue ticket and write what you think is an useful coding exercise for certain concepts. 

2. If enough people are interested in that issue ticket, hopefully either you or someone else will write the exercise statements properly as somehting like a lab exercise/homework.

3. Then someone will fork the repo, write up their solution, with a bit of polish and documentation, submit a pull request. I'm going to write up a contributing guide soon. For now, the guideline is just: create a folder, say '001' with two subfolder 'exercise' and 'solution. Then dump codes inside. I created a silly project 000 as an example of a hello-world Python code.

4. Some of us will scrutinize the codes, review, make suggestions and eventually include (merge) them into the main project repo.

5. Repeat 3-4 above for a particular exercise. Repeat 1-5 indefinitely till we hit 99/99 projects.

## Recruiting core team

For more experienced people or super-eager people, it will be helpful if you could join me in maintaining this repo. Please let me know and we can figure out how we could assemble a core team. Many thanks and hope that everyone will have a great learning experience !


Goal: 99 Projects  
Current: 1 Project

This project is inspired by Unnit Metaliyaâ€™s answer on quota: https://qr.ae/pNK0FW

For credits, these are the two repos (one for C and one for React) where I got the idea from:
- https://github.com/truedl/c-for-beginners 
- https://github.com/UnnitMetaliya/99-reactjs-project-ideas
